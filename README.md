# Reflection Deck
It was very easy. Makeing the turned up ends was harder but once I realized you have to Change the split mode, it was easy. By changeing the split mode I mean change to surface mode in the split tool.

# Designing the trucks Reflection
These were easy, I ran into a few problems with puting on the cross thing that connects the bushing and the round part, getting it centered was hard. I realized that I had to sketch it on a different plane and it was good. Another helpfull tip I learned is to always sketch symetric to the origin, it will help centering stuff.

# Wheels and bearings description
I realized it was easier for me to sketch it as a circle and extrude. I just had to analize the specs more. After I made that genius move, I was proven wrong by Mr.Helmstetter that it is best to revolve a sketch. Revolve a sketch!!!!!!!!

# Puting it all together description
This took a while until I realized it is best to use the replicate tool. After I started useing the replicate tool on the bolts, things went way faster and I got this done in no time.
