#Reflection Deck
It was very easy. Makeing the turned up ends was harder but once I realized you have to Change the split mode, it was easy.

#Designing the trucks Reflection
These were easy, I ran into a few problems with puting on the cross thing that connects the bushing and the round part, getting it centered was hard. I realized that I had to sketch it on a different plane and it was good.

#Wheels and bearings description
These were easy also, I realized it was easier for me to sketch it as a circle and extrude.

#Puting it all together description
This took a while until I realized it is best to do the mirror on simular parts with the bolts.
